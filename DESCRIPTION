Title: Tools for extracting dendrogram and tree diagram
    plot data for use with ggplot.
LazyData: true
LazyLoad: true
Description: This is a set of tools for dendrograms and
    tree plots using ggplot.  The ggplot philosophy is to
    clearly separate data from the presentation.
    Unfortunately the plot method for dendrograms plots
    directly to a plot device without exposing the data.
    The ggdendro package resolves this by making available
    functions that extract the dendrogram plot data.
